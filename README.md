# Visualisation of Optimisation Algorithms

This project is an interactive visualisation of popular optimisation algorithms.

-   The algorithms used can be found in the [Algorithms for Optimisation Book](https://algorithmsbook.com/optimization/files/optimization.pdf) by Kochenderfer and Wheeler
-   The test problems (functions and datasets) can be found in https://www.sfu.ca/~ssurjano/optimization.html

Additionally, this project serves as a benchmark test between the speed of Rust and Python. All the algorithms will be implemented in both languages and benchmarks will be presented below. The backend server and algorithm implementation used for the interactive website will be the rust version. The frontend of the website is written in React with Vite
